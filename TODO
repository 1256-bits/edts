;; TODO
;; - Keep tabs on modules in projects and auto-reload ones that change
;; - Close down (internal) node when last buffer in a project dies
;;   (erl-unload-hook)
;; - Fix bug with "buffer has a running process, kill it?"
;; - Don't start thousands of processes (related to previous point?).
;; - Fix edb-bug
;; - Fix assertion-bug in epmd.el
;; - Run distel nodeup-hook when inferior node is started and use it
;;   to load modules and start services.
;; - erl-who-calls without erl-output buffer.
;; - Can we use epmd-port-please to syncronously check if node is up?
;; - Start an internal node if external node disappears.

;; Wishlist
;; - Indexing of project contents.
