;; TODO
;; - Reasonably intelligent caching of completion results
:: - Load all modules at start and use code-server instead of filelib
::   to generate module-list
;; - Modules outside projects
;; - replace following word if it is same as end of completion
;; - (re?) load modules before trying to extract info
;; - set completion requirement to 1 for all sources
;; - macro completion
;; - record completion
;; - Keep tabs on modules in projects and auto-reload ones that change
;; - Start an internal node if external node disappears.
;; - Better error handling for the rest-communication
;; - Restart edts node, and re-add running project-nodes if it is
;;   down.
;; - Tests

;; Wishlist
;; - Indexing of project contents.
;; - tab-completion or auto-completion in comint-buffer

;; Maybe
;; - Add eper, and a decent user_default to all nodes started by edts.
